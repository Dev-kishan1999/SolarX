# SolarX (CSCI 5709 : Advanced Web Services)

It is crucial to maintain a balance between exploiting natural resources and researching them in the twenty-first century, when people rely entirely on technology. The primary energy source for human-made technology is power. The sun supplies enough energy to satisfy the demands of the entire world, and unlike fossil fuels, it won't run out any time soon. The sole constraint on solar energy as a renewable resource is our aim to efficiently and economically convert it to electricity. The most well-known truth about solar energy is that it is a clean, environmentally friendly form of energy and it is a wonderful option to lessen your carbon impact through solar energy.
